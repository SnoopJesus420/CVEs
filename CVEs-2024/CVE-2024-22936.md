Vulnerability: Reflected XSS

Description: The Genesis School Management Softare is vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack. A reflected XSS vulnerability is when data from a request is copied to the browser in an unsafe way. This attack was identified by utilizing the tool BurpSuite to enumerate vulnerable web applicaiton parameters and injecting JavaScript code to view the behavior of the web application.

Impact: An attacker can insert malicious code within the "message=" paramater. This code can be executed causing the application to run client code unexpectedly. For testing purposes, the impact showed a payload consisting of a basic alert being called utilzing the JavaScript alert(); function. 

Recommendation: To prevent XSS, you must sanitize all untrusted data, even if it is only used in client-side scripts. If you must use user input on your page, always use it in the text context, never as HTML tags or any other potential code. If you can, entirely avoid using user input.
